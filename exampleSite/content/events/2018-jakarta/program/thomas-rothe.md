Do you work in an organization struggling to do more with less? Technical organization looking to deliver faster, cheaper and with better quality. To help accomplish this, increasingly organizations are turning to deliver continuously with small batches.  

Working with small batch sizes has tremendous impact and can radically reduce costs. Reducing batch size is one of the most powerful techniques available for improving the flow and let us deliver quickly and reach project completion earlier.  
In software development terms, following a traditional process means a team will define all of the project’s requirements first, complete all of the design next and then finish all of the coding before testing. Usually, all this happens in big baselined batches.

In contrast, working in small batch sizes means completing, for example, 10% of the design, the development and the testing before moving on to the next 10% of the product’s features.

In this talk, we will look at why Batch Size is so important and how Batch Size affects our daily work. We will go through;
<ul>
	<li>What is Batch Size and how to reduce it</li>
	<li>How to deliver features faster with higher quality</li>
	<li>How testing is related to Batch Size</li>
	<li>What Cycle Time is and how it is related to Batch Size</li>
	<li>How costs and probability of defects is related to Batch Size</li>
</ul>

Regardless of your role in an technical organization, the goals of this presentation are to;
<ul>
	<li>make you think about reducing Batch Size in your team/s</li>
	<li>learn principles how you can reduce Batch Size</li>
	<li>introduce a model how to calculate costs of defects</li>
	<li>understand how Batch Size affects software delivery to reduce costs and validate outcomes earlier</li>
</ul>

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?

It highlights the principle of small batches to deliver frequently. That includes earlier validations of outcomes and reduced risk. A lot of companies in Indonesia moving into Continuous Delivery but struggle to deliver small batches.
This talk will help to create an awareness of one of the key principles of CI/CD.
