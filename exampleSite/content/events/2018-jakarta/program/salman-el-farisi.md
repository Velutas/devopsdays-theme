"Dockerizing your web application stack (Nginx, PHP, MySQL)" is about how to convert your web application stack from multiple VMs or bare metal based into Container based using Docker.

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?
This approach is good for development - production because you can keep the consistency of your application environment no matter what the platform that you use in development phase and your production server use.
