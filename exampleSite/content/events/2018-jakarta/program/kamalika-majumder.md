Change can be good. This talk will give an insight into transformation of a System engineer to a DevOps Consultant - thats me. In this session I will explain how to transform a traditional IT Operations mindset to a DevOps lifestyle without instigating fear of replacement. This will also explain why going DevOps is not a job risk for system engineers or IT.

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?
This will help anyone who is going through or are think about going  Agile but are worried about what will happen to their IT Operations. This will give them guidance on how to bridge the gaps between development teams and ops team.
