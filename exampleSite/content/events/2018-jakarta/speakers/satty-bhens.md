I'm a partner in McKinsey’s New York office and a leader of McKinsey Digital Labs. I serve leading companies across sectors, helping them deploy cutting-edge technology practices from building simple custom apps to enabling end-to-end digital transformations. Using and adapting Agile principles, we work with our clients to design, develop, and deliver fully functioning web-based and mobile applications that deliver tangible value. After deployment, our team provides hands-on support for adoption and works with our clients’ IT organizations to build capabilities, transition the solution in-house, or to provide ongoing support.
