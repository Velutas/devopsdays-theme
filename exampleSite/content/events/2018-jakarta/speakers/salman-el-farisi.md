Hi, My Name is Salman El Farisi. I'm a lead developer at a Private Company engaged in Software Development Business in Depok, West Java. I have 6 years experiences in Java and PHP Programing Language mainly as Web Developer. I have a concern in Software Quality Assurance, but recently I'm interested in DevOps, especially in Docker because recently most of my job is managing the application infrastructure from bare metal server to VM based server.
