Monitoring systems has traditionally been the responsibility of Ops
teams. But if our goal is to align devs, ops, and other roles in the
organization, then we need to ensure they are all monitoring critical
business systems and do so in a way that takes advantage of the unique
perspective that each role offers.

In this session, I’ll break down the expansive monitoring landscape into
5 categories that each provide a unique view of your systems. I’ll show
how each category allows your team to have complete observability, avoid
blind spots, and work together to quickly resolve performance issues and
avoid outages.
