When a datacenter goes offline, a server gets overloaded, or a binary hits a
crashing bug, we usually have a contingency plan. We reduce damage, redirect
traffic, page someone, drop low-priority requests, follow documented
procedures. But why do many failures still come as a surprise? In this talk, we
look at some real life analogs to preventing and managing software failures.
Fire partitions. Public safety campaigns. Smoke alarms. Sprinkler systems.
Doors that say "This is not an exit". And fire escapes. What can we learn from
the real world about expecting failure and designing for it?
