## Workshop

The bigger your infrastructure grows, the harder it becomes to maintain it via interfaces. Once you have AWS, Heroku and Github and 10+ developers it starts feeling the fatigue of adding new people or managing access rules. Infrastructure as code is a solution. And one of the most convenient tools is Terraform, which you can get familiar with in this session.
