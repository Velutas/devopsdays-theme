Don Miguel Ruizâ€™s book, https://www.amazon.com/Four-Agreements-Practical-Personal-Freedom/dp/1878424319/, presents a code of personal conduct based on ancient Toltec wisdom to help remove self-limiting structures and beliefs.

Each of the Four Agreements can help us understand a more mature, effective, and humane approach to incident response in our organizations. In this talk, I will address how the Agreements can be expressed as a modality for Incident Response. Using the Agreements, it is easier to understand modern approaches to resolving incidents as effectively as possible, and even help reduce burnout as well!
