<hr>

For the Austin Summit 2018, we will have three tracks of talks each day after the keynote and will have an open CFP prior to the event. However, talks will be **voted on by the attendees** and the talks that will be given are **selected at the time of the event**. Talks that solve a problem are successful. Mentioning tools and products is fine. Talks that demo a product or are simply a sales pitch are generally not voted up in this format or are poorly attended.  

### How to submit a proposal
