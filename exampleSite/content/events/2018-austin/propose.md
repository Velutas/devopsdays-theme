### Overview

DevOpsDays Austin will adopt the “Summit” conference format for 2018. Speakers will come from and be chosen by conference participants.

### Session Proposal & Acceptance

**Until April 1st,** we will be accepting proposals for sessions. Preliminary acceptance will be performed by the DevOpsDays Austin organizing team. If accepted, your session will enter into a pool of sessions to be voted on by participants the day of the conference; top voted sessions will be put onto the conference schedule. A list of preliminary accepted sessions will be made available on the DevOpsDays Austin 2018 website prior to the conference for attendees to review.

This is a change from previous years where talks were finalized prior to the event.  This does mean that we’re looking for people who want to attend, share, and contribute whether or not their talk is finally accepted.  We will also have openspaces at the event so even if your talk isn’t selected by the larger audience, you can still pitch it and give it to a self-selecting group as an openspace.

### Proposal Template

When submitting your session proposal, email [{{< email_organizers subject="Talk Proposal" >}}] and please utilize the following template:

* Session Title
* Description of Session
* Session Length (35 minute talk or 5 minute Ignite lightning talk)
* Short Bio (about 2 lines)

### Format

* The **ignite lightning talk** format is a 5-minute presentation, where each presenter must use 20 slides, which auto-advance every 15 seconds. There will be at least 16 ignite presentations, presented to all participants.

* **35 minute talks** can consist of whatever you want. A presentation, a demo, a panel, a case study, a “town hall” with short presentation and Q&A, “ask the expert,” or something else!  Let us know in the session description if there’s any stage requirements (like multiple stools for a panel).  There will be at least 18 talks split across three tracks, but we may add more smaller tracks based on response.

### Audience

DevOpsDays Austin attracts a diverse group of technologists interested in DevOps and related topics. This year because of the Summit format, we expect the attendees to be weighted toward intermediate to advanced practitioners that are eager to engage with questions and share what they know as well.

### Tickets

If you have submitted or are thinking about submitting a proposal it is recommended that you purchase your conference tickets asap as there are a limited number of tickets available. We are not comping speaker tickets this year both because of the new selection format and also because the session format has no vendor booths, so the quite modest ticket fee pays for your food, t-shirt, and so on!
