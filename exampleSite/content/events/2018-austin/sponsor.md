### Why Austin?

Austin hosts one of the leading annual DevOpsDays events, now in its **seventh** year. Every year Austin is one of the best attended and reviewed DevOpsDays events. Sponsoring DevOpsDays connects your company to local technical and business minds who influence decisions in security, monitoring, operations, engineering, quality, and product development.

### Why a Summit?

Many DevOpsDays use a small conference format, where there is a sponsor hall with tables, talks are preselected, and so on. While DevOpsDays Austin has had great success with this format in the past, this year we want to have a **more intimate event** that highly engages local experts and thought leaders. As a result, there will be **no sponsor tables this year**, and talks will be **voted on by participants** at conference time. Attendance will be capped at 400 (including sponsors, organizers, and volunteers).

### Happy Hour ($7000)

~~Only 1 available!~~ **Pending!** You sponsor the happy hour. This price covers drink service for the attendees at the stadium venue - but if you want to do something more/different, we are happy to work with you on that.
