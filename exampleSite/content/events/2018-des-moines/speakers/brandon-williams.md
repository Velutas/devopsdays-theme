Brandon Williams is a Systems Engineer at Ramsey Solutions. He's been practicing DevOps for the last few years of his career as he's migrated from application development to AWS deployments and building/bundling application code for distribution. He finds joy in simplifying processes, understands that simple is not easy, and loves sharing all that he learns. When not writing code, blog posts, or listening to technology podcasts, he enjoys going for hikes and playing board and card games with his wife and kids.
