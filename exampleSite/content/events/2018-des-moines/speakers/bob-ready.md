For over a decade, Bob Ready has never strayed far from technology in both career and education. Working in both consumer and enterprise IT environments and focusing on biological data science, his life has revolved around using technology to find the next, better way to do … anything. Currently the head of a DevOps team at INTL FCStone in West Des Moines, Bob focuses on pursuit of process improvement and ruthless elimination of the parts of IT jobs that suck. Late-night phone calls, marathon update weekends, war rooms for massive deployments … why wouldn’t we try to figure out how to avoid this stuff?
