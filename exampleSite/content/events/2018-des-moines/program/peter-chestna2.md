But now, DevOps teams are pushing to release continuously, meaning integrating security will become even more of a challenge. With DevOps, teams will be expected to produce code faster and more often. Yet in order for DevOps to be successful, teams can’t just deliver functional code – they must deliver secure code. How can DevOps teams add security to DevOps without losing velocity? In this session, Peter Chestna, Director of Developer Engagement, describes the pressures on DevOps teams. He will then practical strategies to integrate security successfully into DevOps.
