If you still spell Microsoft with a dollar ($) sign, think the technology platform responds to change as quickly as the Titanic, or still associate Microsoft with Visual Basic 6 (shudder), this ignite talk is for you. In this entertaining and rapid-fire session, we’ll show how Microsoft has embraced Agile, DevOps and open-source practices to innovate faster, engage the dev community, and work on making the “right” products. Then we’ll share how Principal is leveraging the Microsoft stack to advance our own DevOps journey.
