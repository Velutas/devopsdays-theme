Title = "Keeping Secrets - A Demonstration of Using Secrets in Systems Automation"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["pete-torres"]
+++

As Systems Engineers progress into infrastructure as code, how do we protect sensitive data found within our automation work?  let's talk about secrets and some of the tools available for keeping them, as well as step through a demonstration of using secrets in a puppet module.

This talk will discuss a few open source solutions available such as Conjur, Hashicorp Vault, and Encrypted Yaml.  

The demonstration will step through encrypting and decrypting secrets using eYaml and use Test Kitchen  to show a Puppet module using eYaml for protecting passwords in Hiera data.
