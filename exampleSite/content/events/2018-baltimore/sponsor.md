devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during, and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.

The following chart outlines our sponsorship packages. If you have questions or are interested in sponsoring, please check out our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kd33p3QlWEy786C7Y2cfKtvxsmYXyXucu0KCbtpv__A/), or drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}.

<p>
All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
