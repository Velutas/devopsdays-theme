Queueing Theory is perhaps one of the most important mathematical theories in systems design and analysis, yet only few engineers learn it. This talk teaches the basics of queueing theory and explores the ramifications of queue behavior on system performance and resiliency. This workshop aims to give practical skills that can be applied better build and tune your systems. The workhop covers:

- Queueing delays
- Queueing capacity
- Little's Law and how to apply it
- Proper sizing of thread and connection pools
