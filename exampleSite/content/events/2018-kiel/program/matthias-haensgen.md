The usage of a microservices architecture is a significant paradigm change from a monolithic architecture approach. One of the key ingredients to get advantage of a microservices based architecture is the loose (data) coupling of the microservices. Traditional design methods with the usage of one central domain model for the whole system are contradictory to this requirement. Domain-driven design is one approach to design a distributed, decoupled domain model for a microservices based system. The talk shares practical experience for the usage of Domain-driven design in the development of microservices based systems.
