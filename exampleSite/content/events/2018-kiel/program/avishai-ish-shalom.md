In almost every software project, in almost any company, some aspects of the software are neglected: logs are crappy, metrics are badly designed, backups are hard, customer support tooling is an afterthought. Have you ever seen "logging" in the feature list? or "deprecation" for that matter? As almost every software service needs these, why are they often overlooked? Why are some requirements not defined as features? It turns out that when we design our products we ignore certain categories of users, and their use cases are ignored until very late in the life of the product; these are “The missing user stories” The talk will present various user stories, such as "As a Developer I would like to search logs so that I can debug a user transaction" and expand on what is needed to support that story. By doing so we will see how this approach promotes better software and better services.
