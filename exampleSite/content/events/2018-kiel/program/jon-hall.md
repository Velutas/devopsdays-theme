As DevOps becomes increasingly established in enterprises, its practitioners are increasingly finding their products absorbed into traditional IT support structures, and themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure. This presentation explores the problems this creates: its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues, and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing. An alternative is Swarming: an methodology now emerging in forward-looking enterprises, which sets out to dismantle the tiered approach, replacing it with something much more dynamic, lean, and cross-functional.
