After I finished my doctoral thesis at the university of Aachen in 1993, I joined a Northern German based software company as a system analyst. By the end of the nineties I took over project management and sales responsibility. Moving to IBM in 2001, project management with a focus on methods and tools became my profession. Today, I am heading a competence center for DevOps in IBM's services unit in Europe.
