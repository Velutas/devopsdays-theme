Daiany works at Kuehne + Nagel for the KN FreightNet project in Hamburg since 2011. Originally from Venezuela, I joined the company as a software developer but now I am a requirements engineer, collaborating as well with our agile-coaches with Retrospectives-moderation. Agile by nature, I consider fostering collaboration and communication in my team a key part of my work. I am passionate about DevOps, since my department became the 1st one to successfully implement CD in the whole IT organization.
