Integrations engineer and tech writer @sysdig

Mateo greatly enjoys tinkering with container technologies, creating homebrew lab environments, and the perpetual newbie feeling of this fast moving world of tech.
He spends most of the day getting in the shoes of the user at many different levels: user interface, task automation, proper documentation and error handling, code examples, and dissecting deep technical concepts for the newcomers. 
All his former job positions revolve around the confluence of humans and technology, having worked as Evangelist Project manager and pre-sales engineer.
