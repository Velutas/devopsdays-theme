George Miranda is Director of Community for Buoyant, makers of Linkerd and Conduit. He made a career working in WebOps for over 15 years at a variety of startups and enterprises before moving into the world of working with open-source software vendors. He's taken roles at companies that believe in simplifying the ever-increasing complexity of running internet applications at scale. Prior to Buoyant, he was a developer advocate at Chef Software Inc, using config management and automation to manage the shift to running cloud infrastructure. He now builds communities centered around using the service mesh to improve service-to-service communication to manage the shift to running cloud-native services. He enjoys his time living in the Pacific Northwest, small batch artisanal whiskey, and writing conference biographies no one reads.
