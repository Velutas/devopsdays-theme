"We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris." â€“ Larry Wall.

DevOps engineers, if anything, are the epitome of the three great virtues of programmers. Since the advent of DevOps in 2009, engineers created a plethora of tools and systems to automate every aspect of the software development and production lifecycle.

This presentation will dive into the answer of: what happens when a DevOps engineer uses their tradecraft in their home-life?

The toolkit for this presentation includes: readily-available cheap public cloud infrastructure, voice assistants (such as Google Home and Amazon Echo), the RaspberryPi, Messaging apps (e.g. Slack), IoT and APIs for commonly used services for calendaring, todo lists and podcasts. Using this toolkit, the presenters will show examples of how to:

- Manage the home media environment and preferences
- Automate the home calendar and chore scheduling
- Schoolwork and homework tracking

and much more.
