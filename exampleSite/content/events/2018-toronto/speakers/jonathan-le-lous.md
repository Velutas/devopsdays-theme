Jonathan is Director of DevOps at Manulife, Canadian Division. Jonathan is leading DevOps Team and Practice inside Institutional Technology (BU) and Core Engineering and Architecture Team (share service) for Canadian Division: - Building DevOps Strategy (Technologies, Risk, QA, Portfolio…) - Building DevOps Roadmap with Global IT and Canadian DevOps Guild - Leading the Kubernetes and Docker initiative - Build a DevOps Team - More important than everything: Onboard projects and people into DevOps!!!! Speaking experience: - 2 interventions as VP of April.org at Libre Planet- MIT. - Multiple interventions as organizer of OpenStack Days Canada in 2016, member of OpenStack Foundation (5 years) and VP OpenStack France. - Multiple interventions (France): Paris Open Source Summit, Open World Forum, Solution Linux. DevOps, Cloud, Platform, Containers, Microservices, Infrastructure, IT Services: for 15 years, I’ve been passionate by technology and open source. Open Source is more than a development model, it’s a strategy that impacts the entire organization and creates new value chain. These technologies are the foundation to build an efficient, resilient and sustainable IT. Not only for competitiveness but also to empower people! As a pragmatic leader I’m used to work with partners and technologies from everywhere (Microsoft, Red Hat, IBM, Cisco, cloud…) and build bridges between traditional IT and new approaches. As a community member I’ve been engaging in different non-profit communities to contribute and promote open source and help users.
