I am a software engineer consultant at ThoughtWorks that specializes in infrastructure engineering, incident response, and site reliability. I have not been in the field for long, but I’ve been around long enough to realize certain patterns in the industry with fresh eyes. I don’t know everything, and I’m sure as heck not an expert on site reliability and incident response. I’m passionate about using technology for social good and improving the world we live in. At ThoughtWorks, we work with our clients to improve their technology and I’ve been working specifically on a DevOps transformations for the 18 months I’ve been here. On the side, I enjoy doing nonprofit consulting pro bono. My favorite language right now is Python, I’m really excited about containerization, and I’m a huge advocate of CI/CD.
