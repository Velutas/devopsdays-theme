I am a software developer who stumbled upon testing out of necessity and never managed to truly leave. I am spent most of my career writing code for medical devices - a high-stakes industry where effective testing is critical (and often involves actual human bodies). I also worked at Unity as an SDET (aka “a software developer who tests”) in the Animation and Storytelling teams.

I am currently a researcher at the National Research Council Canada (NRC) where I study the convergence of virtual reality, gaming technology and medical devices, and where I help Canadian medical device companies bring innovative technologies to market.
