I’ve been working with AWS for over six years and have been a Sysad / Systems Engineer / Computer Nerd for close to two decades. I lead the CloudOps team at Bright Health, an insurance startup that is making waves across the US and we’re pushing the limits in AWS to make everything machine scale as we rapidly grow. In my spare time I’m an organizer for DevOpsDays Austin and a volunteer with Girl Scouts. I also love to check out the craft brew scene in Texas and am working on blogging as a bit of personal kaizen. In a previous life I was an Eagle Scout and am an Iraq Veteran.
