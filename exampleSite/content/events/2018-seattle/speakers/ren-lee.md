Ren is an infrastructure and ops engineer at Arista Networks, busy being a jack-of-all-trades debugging linux servers at datacenters, all the way to building all sorts of automation beasts that control server fleets and services. Her passion is to make things run faster and faster with even less keystrokes by writing friendly, intelligent automation so that everyone else can have more time to do the things machines canâ€™t do. Like enjoying a nice cup of coffee.
