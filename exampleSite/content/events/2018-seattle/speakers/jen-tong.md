Jen is a Security Advocate on Google Cloud Platform. In this role she helps developers and IT professionals stay out of trouble while getting the most out of cloud computing. Previously she worked in a wide variety of engineering roles from robotics at NASA, to developer advocacy for Google Glass.

She is passionate about education, especially on the subjects of technology and science. If she’s away from her laptop, she’s probably skating around a roller derby track, or hanging from aerial silk.
