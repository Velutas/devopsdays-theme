My educational background is in Psychology and Women's Studies, which makes the move to programming and development a seemingly large leap. That jump is smaller than one might think, as years of study in human development and behavior gives me an interesting perspective on interface design. I am working to refine my skills, and learn as much as possible to compliment my background.
