I am Kayla Maria Rodriguez and I am 21 years old. I am of Puerto Rican descent, I am autistic and gay. I am an AADD (All About Developmental Disabilities) Ambassador and I won a Golden Goal Goldie Award for Best Young Community Advocate in October 2017. I am also involved with ASAA (Autism Self-Advocacy of Atlanta) and I’m also a co- founder of The Spectrum Codes alongside Kim Crayton. The Spectrum Codes helps people on the autism spectrum get careers in tech. I hope to be a back-end programmer and a successful self-advocate. With the challenges I’ve encountered in my life being all that I am, I hope to motivate and educate people with my experiences.
