These days I’m a software engineer working in the .Net stack with SQL Server. Getting to where I am today has involved degrees, late nights, and a wonky mix of good and bad ideas, jobs, dates, and mockups. When not sampling bourbons, scotches, and/or beers, I’m usually at a conference or meetup about development, agile practices, or board games. If you spot me wandering around, snare my attention and let’s exchange war stories. Have you been to DragonCon?
