About Alicia Carr In 2011, while standing online at the Apple store waiting to buy my second generation iPad I met a 16-year-old young man. I asked him how did he get the money to buy an iPad and he told me he made a lot of money creating apps. Then I asked him how did he learn how to create an app. He said from youtube and That’s when I turn to my husband and told him “I want to do that.” I started learning how to code in May 2012. On November 2, 2012 (will never forget the day) my husband told me to quit my job to follow my dream to become an iOS developer. It took me 1½ years to learn Objective C. After books and online courses I went through, I started working on the Purple Pocketbook in January 2014 and finished the first version in March 2014. After a month of submitting the app to Apple, it finally got approved on May 2, 2014. Purple Pocketbook is now Purple Evolution, Inc, (PEVO) the first domestic violence app for the state of Georgia which is now a national app. Early 2014 I found and join the group called Women Who Code and I was so excited to be with other ladies wanting to connect and learn from each other that where coders as well. I then started the group within WWCODE called women iOS (WiOS) Developer Group. I became such an active member of the group over two years working with WWCODE that Erica Stanley Founder/Director of WWCode Atlanta and Alaina Percival CEO/Founder WWCode felt I was an excellent fit for the Director of the Atlanta chapter. And I love Women Who Code it like family. Living my dream I am 53 years old, been married for 35 years, have 3 children and 8 grandchildren. I love life, and I am experiencing my dreams as often and as soon as I can achieve them. My passion in life has been to be an entrepreneur and help others to see life differently with strength and passion.
