Mike is a regulatory compliance consultant, which is as much fun as it sounds. He left Google as he found the politics annoying and now works for fscom, a Belfast based consultancy where he advises firms on how to detect money laundering and fraud.

Mike has always repaired his own cars, having started off by servicing an old Peugeot 205 (the wrong sort, a diesel) and moving on to welding and more serious stuff. He has discovered that bodywork takes bloody ages and more patience than he really has, hence building a car without any. Mike's approach is more akin to diving in and hoping he can swim and when in doubt find a hammer.
