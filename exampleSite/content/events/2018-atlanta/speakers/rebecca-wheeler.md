Veteran cab driver, Rookie Tech.  After a 15 year career in cab driving, I decided I wanted to go to college and make something of myself.  I’m graduating with an Associate’s degree in Network Security in May this year and have two years of general help desk and networking experience under my belt.  Adjusting to a 9-5 has been fabulous, editing my sailor’s mouth has been difficult.  I gravitate to DevOps for the touchy-feely parts as I transition my career and work culture, but appreciate and absorb the technical parts to see how everything fits together.
