I work at a call center that offers IT support. If you’ve talked to me, you probably don’t like me. However, if you know what to expect when you call, the chances of you both getting your computer fixed and you being happier in general are much higher.

This is a talk that sets out the general support process when calling to request technical support for your personal electronics. Many customers who need a repair for a personal computer either don’t understand this process or haven’t prepared for technical problems that would cause them to call.
