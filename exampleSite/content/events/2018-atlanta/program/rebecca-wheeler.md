Impostor Syndrome is traditionally seen in high-achieving individuals who have an inability to internalize their accomplishments and merits.  They are plagued by fear that a misstep or mistake will expose them as frauds and their house of cards will come crashing down.  Traditions aside, I believe all of us have experienced this at some point or on a regular basis and Iâ€™d like to discuss possible ways to deal with or overcome it, at least temporarily.
