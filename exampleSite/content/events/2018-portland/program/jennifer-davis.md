A function is deployed and alerts go off. When our intrepid site reliability engineer responds to the change in availability she begins the task of debugging and implementing new tests to catch the issue in future deployments. While the nature and complexity of computing changes, the need for specialized operations engineering skills increases. In this talk, we will explore the path of ever changing technology and the continued need for different roles to be successful regardless of technology. We'll focus on three critical parts in serverless through real world examples in testing, monitoring, and debugging.
