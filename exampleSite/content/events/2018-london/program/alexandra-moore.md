I have been delivering workshop sessions in Leeds and Manchester, using the three ways of DevOps to spark discussion and ideas.  We have not just been working with people in Dev or Ops but also managers, test professionals, support teams and people from other areas of their business.

In each case, I give a short talk about the Three Ways, assigning a personality to each one: "Gods", "Investigative Reporters" and "Geniuses".  While emphasising that DevOps is about ALL three ways, I ask everyone to choose the personality or way that most interests them.  Each team dives in to describe how they are going to make improvements in their roles and in their organisations according to their 'way'.  The responses have been so interesting and I would love to share them with DevOpsDays London.  Maybe others would like to spread the good word in this way too!
