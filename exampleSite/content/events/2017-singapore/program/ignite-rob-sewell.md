Can I teach you to do Continuous Delivery to the PowerShell Gallery for your PowerShell Modules in 5 minutes?

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?

Relational databases are further behind in the DevOps cycle than many other areas of the industry and this talk will add in a light hearted fashion some excellent points to think about. (also I am presenting a pre-con and sessions at PSConfAsia)
