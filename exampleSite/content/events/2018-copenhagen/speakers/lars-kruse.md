Lars holds an M.Sc in Computer Science from the University of Roskilde. Throughout all of his career he has worked with specific focus on techniques, strategies, and tools to ensure that quality is built into software - as opposed to be glued on. Lars is on a mission to change the world for the better - at least the part of it that runs on software. Co-founder of Praqma and currently working as a Digital transformer and Rainmaker.
