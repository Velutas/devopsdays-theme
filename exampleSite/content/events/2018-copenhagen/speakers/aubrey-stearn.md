Head of DevOps @ Arcadia Group

I am currently head of DevOps for the Arcadia group in the UK.

Iâ€™m fusing development and operations to create a team of elite Site Reliability Engineers embedded in each development squad. Platforms not Projects!

I have previously worked with PizzaHut, Travelodge and smaller scale start-ups.

I love JavaScript and Terraform equally.
