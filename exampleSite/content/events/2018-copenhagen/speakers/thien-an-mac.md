**Qwops at Thoughtworks**

Ops, QA, developer; those are some of the job titles I have held in the past. I have worked on 4 different continents around the world, and worked in several industries; from insurance, banking and even in automotive. I am currently working as a technologist at ThoughtWorks. Not only do I write code (Ruby, Terraform, Chef, you name it), but I also help clients establish an effective working culture by encouraging best practices and also share my love for food, random trivia facts and movie quotes.
