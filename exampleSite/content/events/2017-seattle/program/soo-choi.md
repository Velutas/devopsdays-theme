  <h3>Why so angry, Soo?  Or how I learned to stop worrying and love public speaking.</h3>

  <p>Public speaking is hard and this talk is about how I overcome that fear.  I avoided public speaking for years.  Whenever I speak, people compare me to Gordon Ramsay: I can't not sound angry even though I'm not.  But I had a recent breakthrough and I want to share this journey with you.  There's a lesson for everyone in this talk as we examine the role of women in tech, challenges of travel, tech conferences, the DevOps community, and more.</p>
