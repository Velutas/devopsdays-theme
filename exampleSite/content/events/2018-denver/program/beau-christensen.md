Title = "Going Multi-Master: Making Practical Decisions When Building Distributed Systems"
Type = "talk"

As technology professionals, it is our responsibility to build systems capable of surviving in unreliable, unpredictable environments. Distributed, multi-regional systems are becoming more commonly requested by customers - from enterprises to SMB.

In this talk, we will discuss some actionable steps Developers, Architects, Site Reliability Engineers, and IT Engineers can make to reliably move their systems into a globally distributed deployment posture, and eventually into a multi-master active/active state.

Identifying seams in our application is a key skill Learn how to carve off pieces of your front-end applications and evolve them into stateless, durable edge services running on common technologies like Kubernetes.

Tackling application state is one of the trickiest areas of distributed computing. Learn what’s worked and what hasn’t worked, and how state decisions can drastically affect the deployability and architecture of your application.

See how Chaos Engineering can be leveraged from the start to encourage responsible design choices while architecting your services.:w
