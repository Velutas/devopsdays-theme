With the proliferation of container and cloud technologies, Kubernetes is currently becoming the de facto standard for cloud container orchestration. And although, Kubernetes itself does a fantastic job of running and scaling the container workloads it has been entrusted with, it does not take care of its own infrastructure. The X project was started last year to overcome this problem. This presentation will overview the challenges that the X team faced during the engineering process, and will elaborate on the most crucial decisions and solutions. In conclusion, the achieved disaster recovery and upgrade scenarios will be demonstrated using a cluster that will be deployed during the presentation.
